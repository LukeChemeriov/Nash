# Nash Framework

The Nash Framework is an early-stage application engine, designed primarily for the development of server-side CLI applications. Currently, little features have been implemented. 

## Getting started with Nash

Nash can be used on any platform, with most IDEs. Generally, it is aimed towards support with common IDEs, like Visual Studio, CodeLite, CodeBlocks, and more.

**Downloading the required files**
To download the needed files to work with Nash, start by cloning the repository into your working directory. You can do this with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/LukeChemeriov/Nash`.
If at any point, you did *not* include the `--recursive` flag, then use `git submodule update --init` to make sure you have installed the neccasary submodules.

## The Plan for Nash

The plan for Nash, is mostly to create both an independent, open-source server-side development framwork, but also to have a simple, intuitive UI, allowing new and/or inexperienced programmers to pick up using the framwork easily. 


## Features still to come:
<ul>
<li>Faster app compilation (in fact, compilation at all)</li>
<li>Custom API</li>
<li>Fully featured editor application(s)</li>
<li>Fully documented interaction and behaviour</li>
<li>Basic Artificial Intelligence</li>
<li>Audio System</li>
</ul>

*Looks like you've reached the end!*
